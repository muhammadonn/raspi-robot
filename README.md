Building an autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi 4

Our project journey will be as follows:

1. First step will be controlling the motors via the motor driver to allow for  movement.
2. Secondly, we would want to start streaming videos from the raspberry pi camera and save snapshots for processing.
